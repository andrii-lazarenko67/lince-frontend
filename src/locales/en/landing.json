        {
          "question": "What is LINCE and who is it for?",
          "answer": "LINCE is a complete monitoring and inspection management platform for water systems. It is designed for two profiles: End Customers (companies that manage their own water systems like ETE/ETA stations, pools, cooling towers, boilers) and Service Providers (companies that provide water treatment services to multiple clients)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between End Customer and Service Provider mode?",
          "answer": "In End Customer mode, the platform is organized as: Systems → Stages → Records/Inspections/Occurrences. In Service Provider mode, the hierarchy changes to: Client → Systems → Stages → Data. This allows service providers to manage multiple separate client portfolios with strict data isolation. You choose your mode during onboarding."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can technicians use LINCE in the field on mobile devices?",
          "answer": "Yes. LINCE is a fully responsive web application that works on any device — desktop, tablet, and smartphone. Technicians can log daily measurements, conduct photo inspections, and report incidents directly from their mobile browser in the field."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does the AI integration work?",
          "answer": "LINCE integrates with Claude AI (by Anthropic) to provide intelligent analysis of your operational data. The AI can detect anomalies, identify trends, compare periods, generate smart reports, and answer questions about your data via an interactive chat assistant. AI features are optional and can be enabled with your own API key."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I build custom inspection checklists?",
          "answer": "Yes. LINCE allows you to fully configure your inspection checklists — create custom items for each system or stage, mark them compliant/non-compliant, add comments, and attach photos. Checklist items are configured by managers and reused across inspections."
        },
        {
          "question": "What types of reports can I generate?",
          "answer": "LINCE features a \"Build Your Own Report\" system where you create reusable templates by selecting blocks (branding, monitoring tables, inspection results, incident summaries, photos, digital signatures, attachments). Reports are generated as professional PDFs with your branding and real operational data."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is my clients' data completely isolated in Service Provider mode?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Every record, inspection, occurrence, photo, and report in LINCE is tagged with a client_id at the database level. This means Client A's data is completely inaccessible when working in Client B's context. Service provider users can only see clients they have been granted access to."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I try LINCE before purchasing?",
          "answer": "Yes. All plans include a 14-day free trial with full access to all features. No credit card is required to start. You can explore the entire platform, create systems, run inspections, and generate reports during your trial period."
        },
        {
          "question": "What notifications does LINCE send?",
          "answer": "LINCE supports email notifications (via SendGrid) and optional SMS for: out-of-range parameter values, inspection deadlines, incident status updates, low product stock alerts, and custom system notifications configured by administrators."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can multiple technicians use the same account?",
          "answer": "Yes. LINCE supports multiple users per organization with role-based access: Admin (full platform access), Manager (access to their systems and reports), and Technician (data entry and field operations). User management is available in all Professional and Enterprise plans."
